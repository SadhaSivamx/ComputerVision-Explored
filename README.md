## Max Pooling Layer (MPL) 

Max pooling is a crucial layer in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enhancing their ability to recognize and learn hierarchical features from input data. This layer downsamples the spatial dimensions of the input volume, retaining the most significant information by selecting the maximum value from a set of neighboring values within a specified window or kernel. Max pooling aids in reducing computation, mitigating overfitting, and maintaining essential features for effective image recognition and feature extraction in deep learning models.

## Convolutional 2D (C2D) 

Convolutional 2D (2-dimensional) refers to a technique commonly used in deep learning and specifically in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for processing data that has a grid-like topology, such as images.
In a CNN, a 2D convolution involves sliding a small matrix (called a kernel or filter) over the input image in a systematic way, performing element-wise multiplication between the kernel and a region of the input, and summing up the results to produce a single output value for each position. This operation is performed across the entire input image, and the resulting output is often referred to as a feature map or activation map.
