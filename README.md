## Max Pooling Layer (MPL) 
Max pooling is a crucial layer in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enhancing their ability to recognize and learn hierarchical features from input data. This layer downsamples the spatial dimensions of the input volume, retaining the most significant information by selecting the maximum value from a set of neighboring values within a specified window or kernel. Max pooling aids in reducing computation, mitigating overfitting, and maintaining essential features for effective image recognition and feature extraction in deep learning models.
